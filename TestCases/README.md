A collection of tests carried out on the web application at the link - [To-Do App](https://todomvc.com/examples/vue/) on the to-do list available there.

Created in Python with Selenium and PyTest, as an exercise and adaptation to the aforementioned tools.

<h3>The tests were divided into 4 categories:</h3>
- Adding new things to the list
- Removing things from the list
- Categorising things into completed / active
- Stress tests

Each test is described in terms of what it does and the steps involved in its completion and execution.
